# Weather Phenomenon Recognition using Deep Learning

This project develops deep learning models to classify weather phenomena from images.

## Project Overview

Part of MIS373 - Advanced AI For Business course. Uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze and classify 2,726 weather images into 5 categories: fogsmog, rain, rime, sandstorm, and snow.

## Key Components

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Development of various deep learning models
- Performance comparison and analysis
- Discussion on improving model performance for real-world applications

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab (with GPU)
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, tensorflow, etc. and applying deep learning frameworks

## Results

The result has been summarized directly in the Andrew_Nguyen_MIS373A2_Task2.ipynb file. The MIS373_Task2_Testing.ipynb file are where I first training multiple models to get the best one
